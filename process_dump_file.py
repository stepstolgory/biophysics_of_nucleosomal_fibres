# Program to read in a dump file frame by frame
# and do some calculations.

# Example here is radius of gyration
# Here Rg of all atoms in the file are calculated

# Assumes the dump file has the following format
# id type x y z ix iy iz
# were x  etc. are atom coordinates, and are numbers between -L/2 and L/2
#      ix etc. are image flags for taking periodic boundaries into account

# Assumes that atom ids start at 1 and are continuous between 1...N

#***************************************************************************
# NOTE : Be careful NOT to use this code for the case of a dump line with  *
#        xs ys zs as in that case the atom coordinates have been scaled    *
#        to lie between 0 and 1                                            *
